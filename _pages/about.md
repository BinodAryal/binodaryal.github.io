I am a technology and business enthusiast, pursuing an MBA. I am enrolled in the MBA-IT program at [SOMTU]. (http://somtu.edu.np/). I am currently working broadly on my researches on topics such as technology leadership and product management. I regularly learn about topics such as business intelligence & analysis, market analysis, data visualization, and project management. I am also a consultant for IT-Startups.

I have completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Information Technology from Tribhuvan University (Ambition College) in 2018. Prior to joining SOMTU, I work as a system designer, and developer in pirate IT-firm.
